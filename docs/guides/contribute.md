title: Nucleus Workflow
---

This document describes at a high level the end-to-end workflow of using and contributing to the Nucleus Distribution. [optional] The following page describes each step in much greater detail. 

It is interesting to consider that since there is substantial cost and effort to get started as a user, the marginal cost of contributing is rather small. This means every user ought to be a constributor. 

## Sourcing materials

It all starts with sourcing materials. Most materials are bought from third party vendors. Every instance includes a bill of materials and recommended vendors to source them from. Other materials such as the plasmids contained in the Nucleus DNA Distribution and Nucleus Reagent Kits can be acquired from b.next.

- Nucleus DNA Distribution
- Nucleus Reagent Kits

## Preparing your lab for synthetic cell work

We have a number of guide that walk you through best practices for making and storing foundational stocks so that you can easily get started working on cytosols, cells, and assemblies.

- guide for buffers
- guide for transformations
- best practices for experimental design

## Make an instance

Most people will want to make a specific instance to build upon and modify for their own work. In this case we will use plamGFP cytosol as an example. Review the protocol accompanying documentation before going into the lab. Most instances will include one or more Processes or Modules. 

[There should be something here about how to plan an experiment and what a Nucleus compatible platemap format should be; the platemap format can be included in the Instance Template so that people can more easily contribute data as a validation DevNote]

## Analyze the data in Nucleus Hub

Having made an instance of the plamGFP cytosol you will also have your own performance data. The performance data can be analyzed using the Cell Development Kit (CDK) which can be accessed on Nucleus Hub.

## Share your data as Developer Note

Now that you have analyzed your data using Jupyter Hub, you can quickly share your data with the Developer Community. While using a off-the-shelf reagent kit to express plamGFP might seem like a small feat, sharing replication data when benchmarked correctly is a valuable contribution and let's the rest of the Developer Community know that you committed to building reproducible synthetic cells that work.

## Integration into the Distribution

Every three months Developer Notes are reviewed by the core development team and integrated into the distribution to ensure quality and interoperability. We focus on contributions that are regarded as highly useful to the developer community or are very well aligned with the technical roadmap. 

We have a strong preference for contributions that adhere to the Module Contribution Criteria. 

- Cytosol Module Contribution Guidelines
- Synthetic Cell Contribution Guidelines

If you are developing a module whose performance not be properly assessed by one of these criteria, we would invite a Developer Note suggesting a proper criteria.
