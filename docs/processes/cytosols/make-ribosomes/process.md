# Protocol

** Cell culture**

- [ ]  Prepare overnight cultures.

:::{tip} Note: we purify ribosomes from *E. coli* A19 biomass
:class: droptown
We purify RNAs and Riboproteins from *E. coli* A19 biomass ([CGSC 5997](https://ecgrc.net/index.php/product/a19/)), a strain with a mutation in RNase I that improves RNA yields. You can use other RNase deficient strains with this protocol, but you may need to optimize this protocol to achieve high yield and purity.
:::

    - [ ] Add 5 mL Luria Broth (LB) under sterile conditions to two (2) 14 mL culture tubes.
    - [ ] Label one tube “(+)”. Add 10 uL of A19 glycerol stock to (+).

:::{tip} Note: you can work from glycerol stocks OR colonies.

We first need to prepare bacterial cultures. We will work from 6 mL overnight cultures of our expression strains and backdilute them the next day. In order to prepare these overnight cultures, we need stocks of bacteria.

We worked from 100 uL aliquots of our glycerol stocks, frozen in PCR strip tubes. When seeding our overnights with bacteria, we poked one glycerol aliquot with a pipette tip and ejected the tip into culture tubes (more details below).

Optionally, you can work from individual colonies by streaking out your bacterial stocks. Working from colonies assures that your bulk outgrowth will have come from a single colony forming unit.
:::

    - [ ]  Label the other tube “(-)”. This will be your negative control, testing if your technique is sterile.
    - [ ]  Incubate both tubes overnight shaking at 37C / (225-250) rpm / (12-16) hr.

- [ ]  Perform bulk outgrowth.

    - [ ]  Check if (-) has growth. If not, continue.
    - [ ]  Back dilute overnight 1:250 - 1:1000 into 4x 450 mL fresh LB in 2 L baffled Erlenmeyer flasks (e.g., 1.8 mL overnight into 450 mL LB).
    - [ ]  Incubate back diluted cultures at 37C / (225-250) rpm to mid-log phase (OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8, typically ~3 hrs).

- [ ]  Pellet, wash, and store cells.

    - [ ]  Fill 1 L centrifuge bottles with culture. Balance centrifuge bottles against each other and centrifuge cultures at 16 000 rcf / 4C / 10 min.
    - [ ]  Decant supernatant, add fresh culture, and repeat centrifugation as above, working through the remaining culture. You should end up with large pellets at the bottom of each centrifuge bottle.
    - [ ]  Wash the pellets by resuspending (4C) NaCl (0.9%) in about 50 mL and transfer the resuspended cells to a single centrifuge bottle. Dilute to ~500 mL and re-pellet at 16 000 rcf / 4C / 10 min.
    - [ ]  Transfer pellets by spatula into a tared bag weigh and record the mass.
    - [ ]  Flash freeze pellet in liquid nitrogen and store at -80C.
