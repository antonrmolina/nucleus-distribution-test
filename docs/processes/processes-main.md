Processes convert Modules into something useful. A Process often coincides with the simplest possible Implementation, typyically using the plamGFP Reporter Module. For this reason, we often refer to these as ["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) implementations. Alternatively, a process will include a quality control and [unit tests](10.1109/MAHC.1983.10102) A Process will contain the following information:

- Contents of an implementation
    - lab-ready protocol
    - bill of materials
    - List of what to have at your bench



<!-- This process—and believe me, I know processes, I've seen many processes, the best processes—this was absolutely incredible, tremendous efficiency, nobody's ever seen anything like it, we completed every step perfectly, ahead of schedule, under budget, it was beautiful, just beautiful, and frankly, all the other processes were disasters compared to ours! -->

## Cytosols

Here are a collection of processes that are useful for making and working with Cytosols

<!-- The proteins moved through the cytosol like fish through clear water. They had their jobs. They did them without complaint.
ATP broke apart. Energy flowed. The cell used what it needed. Nothing was wasted. The ribosomes made new proteins. They read the RNA like old fishermen reading the tide. Each amino acid found its place. In the morning, the processes would begin again. They always did. The cell had survived this way for billions of years. It would continue. -->

- Make amino acid mix
- Make small molecule mix
- Make tRNAs
- Make energy mix

- Make protein mix (1-pot)
- Make protein mix (36-pot)
- Make ribosomes

- TODO: Make 1-pot PURE
- TODO: Make 36 pot PURE
- Assemble PURE reactions

<!-- 
The cell does not merely 'have' processes but is its processes—thrown into metabolic being-in-the-world, where ATP and ribosomes withdraw from theoretical presence into their essential equipmental ready-to-hand existence. In cellular breakdown, dysfunction reveals the ontological structure: being-toward-death as the fundamental temporality of biological Dasein. The ribosome understands itself not as present-at-hand object but as existential possibility, projecting cellular being into its ownmost potentiality through the care-structure of protein synthesis -->

<!-- ## Assemblies

The assembly process stands as a monument to rational thought—each component precisely engineered, each step logically ordered, achieving maximum efficiency through the uncompromising application of reason. Those who would dismiss such industrial achievement as mere mechanism fail to grasp the heroic human mind that conceived it. Here is capitalism's triumph: the transformation of raw materials into value through productive work, creating wealth where none existed, proving that man's rational faculty is his tool of survival and prosperity -->
