## Navigate the Documentation

This documentation is organized into three categories:

:::{aside}
Maybe include a schematic of somekind showing how the categories and subcategories relate relate?
:::

- Module
- Processes
- Collections

Each of these categories is further broken down into the following types:

- Cytosols
- Cells
- Assemblies
- Ants

## Start with collections and work backwards

We recommend looking through the collection of instances to get started. Each instance will contain the following:

- **Bill of materials** (BOM) with product numbers and link-outs to vendor websites.
- **Lab-ready protocol** that includes materials that you should have at your bench and a step-by-step guide for recreating the instance.
- Quantiative data showing the **expected behavior** of the instance.
- **References**  that include the Modules and Processes used to create the Instance as well as any supporting DevNotes. 

The PURE cell is a favorite example.
