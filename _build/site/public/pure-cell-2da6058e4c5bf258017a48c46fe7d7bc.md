## Overview

PURE liposomes are the basis of a synthetic cell that can perform the fundamental operations of biology: transcription, and translation.

In this protocol, you will make the necessary precursors to creating liposomes, assemble a PURE cell-free reaction that will express Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and encapsulate it within a liposome. For the outer solution, you will use the same simple sugar solution that was used in [Buffer-in-Buffer Liposomes](https://www.notion.so/Buffer-in-Buffer-Liposomes-c15ada1e2f19426fa955d73138249eb9?pvs=21).

Successfully built PURE liposomes will start dark and then increase in green fluorescence over time as GFP is produced.

There are four key stages to making PURE liposomes:

| Step | Process | Hands-on Time | Total Time | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [**Prepare stock buffers and lipids**](https://www.notion.so/PURE-Cell-412dfbe9ffd941bfab16b69ec866de27?pvs=21) | 1 h | 4 h | Buffers and lipids may be prepared in advance and used for experiments on subsequent days. |
| 2 | [**Assemble PURE reactions**](https://www.notion.so/PURE-Cell-412dfbe9ffd941bfab16b69ec866de27?pvs=21) | 1 h | 1 h |  |
| 3 | [**Encapsulate liposomes**](https://www.notion.so/PURE-Cell-412dfbe9ffd941bfab16b69ec866de27?pvs=21) | 2 h | 2 h |  |
| 4 | [**Measure and image**](https://www.notion.so/PURE-Cell-412dfbe9ffd941bfab16b69ec866de27?pvs=21) | 1 h | 6â€“12 h | Total time depends on the exact experiment and incubation conditions. GFP expression should be seen over the first 6 hours at 37C.
