Further, useful information is often buried deep within PDFs or not available at all, slowing down the process of research. Nucleus is intended to be a knowledge sharing platform that emphasizes reproducibility and accessibility that should improve the quality of research and complement existing knowledge sharing practices.","type":"content","url":"/docs/about/faqs#id-1-how-is-sharing-through-nucleus-different-from-existing-options","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"FAQs","lvl2":"2.

If your university holds the patent you may have to petition them to license the contribution using a suitable tool that provides a patent license (e.g. \n\nCERN-OHL-P-2.0). In general, unless a technology is being actively commercialized, a patent can hinder innovation if it prevents the technology from being used by others. Open access licensing will help fulfill the goals of making technology available for the public benefit in such instances.","type":"content","url":"/docs/about/faqs#id-3-what-if-i-have-a-module-that-i-want-to-contribute-but-is-subject-to-a-patent","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"FAQs","lvl2":"4.

In general, if a journal accepts content that has been previously placed on a preprint server, then they should also accept content that has been shared as a DevNote.
