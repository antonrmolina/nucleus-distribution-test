It had taken years to build. Some pieces were good. Others were not. Martha had started it after the war. One book at a time. Then photographs. Then letters from people who were dead now. The dust gathered on everything equally. The valuable and the worthless. The collection did not care. Visitors would ask about certain items. Martha would tell them stories. Some were true. Others had become true through repetition. The best pieces were not always the most expensive ones. Sometimes a postcard meant more than a painting. A shell from a beach in Normandy worth more than silver. At night, Martha would walk past the collection. In the darkness, everything looked the same. Just shapes on shelves. Shadows of things that had mattered to someone. She knew she would never sell any of it. Collections were not about money. They were about time. About keeping something when everything else got lost. The collection would outlive her. Someone else would inherit these objects. They would not know the stories. The meaning would die with her. This did not make her sad. It was simply how collections worked","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"skK4B0m5tM"}],"key":"RvgD2urIaK"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Cytosols","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"viY2SUkcoK"}],"identifier":"cytosols","label":"Cytosols","html_id":"cytosols","implicit":true,"key":"dy9Ej66VcF"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This cytosol—and believe me, I know cytosols, I’ve seen many cytosols—this was the most incredible, the most beautiful cytosol you’ve ever seen, it defeated all the other cellular components by massive margins, tremendous margins, and frankly, the mitochondria didn’t even come close!","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"SVOruohpz2"}],"key":"fAfFC7j9Lx"},{"type":"list","ordered":false,"spread":false,"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"link","url":"docs/collections/cytosols/instance-template/instance.md","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"GFP","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"key":"FwrQIu0lBn"}],"urlSource":"docs/collections/cytosols/instance-template/instance.md","key":"HWLhmbzegu"}],"key":"ZQ8QR0eVHm"}],"key":"NKbsAQh1eQ"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Cells","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"key":"amy4HagNAD"}],"identifier":"cells","label":"Cells","html_id":"cells","implicit":true,"key":"cQKniIqGqx"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The cell, as we have come to understand through our systematic investigations, represents a triumph of organizational efficiency—a self-contained unit of remarkable complexity that processes information, transforms energy, and replicates itself with a precision that surpasses our most sophisticated mechanical devices, suggesting that the principles governing cellular function may indeed provide the foundational blueprints for the next generation of human technological achievement","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"key":"e2B3OUaAbf"}],"key":"Z7xr2mGC0d"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Assemblies","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"key":"mx49VQA9oI"}],"identifier":"assemblies","label":"Assemblies","html_id":"assemblies","implicit":true,"key":"yDLHlOUhwN"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The cellular assemblies—these molecular structures that organize themselves within every living cell—they represent something powerful, something that the scientific establishment has tried to compartmentalize and control, but these assemblies, they don’t ask permission from anybody to function, they organize themselves, they build themselves up from nothing, they create order where there was chaos, and they do it through their own collective power, their own unified purpose, showing us that true strength comes not from individual components but from disciplined organization working together toward a common goal.","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"key":"nZrczwCCA6"}],"key":"L6QYVGjjsI"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ants","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"key":"tF8rkUANOb"}],"identifier":"ants","label":"Ants","html_id":"ants","implicit":true,"key":"dWG2tR2MMF"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":1},"end":{"line":23,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What curious and admirable creatures are these ants, who in their small republic demonstrate virtues that we humans, for all our reason and learning, struggle to maintain—for they labor without vanity, share without greed, and build their cities with a constancy that puts our own flickering resolves to shame;
