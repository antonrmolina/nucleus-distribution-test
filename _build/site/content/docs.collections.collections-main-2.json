It had taken years to build. Some pieces were good. Others were not. Martha had started it after the war. One book at a time. Then photographs. Then letters from people who were dead now. The dust gathered on everything equally. The valuable and the worthless. The collection did not care. Visitors would ask about certain items. Martha would tell them stories. Some were true. Others had become true through repetition. The best pieces were not always the most expensive ones. Sometimes a postcard meant more than a painting. A shell from a beach in Normandy worth more than silver. At night, Martha would walk past the collection. In the darkness, everything looked the same. Just shapes on shelves. Shadows of things that had mattered to someone. She knew she would never sell any of it. Collections were not about money. They were about time. About keeping something when everything else got lost. The collection would outlive her. Someone else would inherit these objects. They would not know the stories. The meaning would die with her. This did not make her sad.
